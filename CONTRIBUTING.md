# contributing

hey thanks for being interested in contributing! heres some loose guidelines

## the vibe

this is a side project so dont stress too much about perfection. if your code works and makes sense, its probably fine

## how to contribute

1. fork the repo
2. make ur changes
3. open a pr with a description of what u did

## code style

- no strict rules really, just try to match whats already there
- comments are nice if something isnt obvious
- i use lowercase for most things (see: entire readme lol)

## ideas for contributions

- more personality modes would be cool
- mastodon/bluesky support
- better image handling
- anything in the todo list tbh

## bugs

if something breaks just open an issue with:
- what happened
- what you expected
- error logs if any

## questions?

open an issue, ill try to respond when i can

---

p.s. dont worry about following every rule perfectly, im pretty chill about stuff
